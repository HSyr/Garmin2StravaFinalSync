# Garmin2StravaFinalSync
When the Strava account is connected to a Garmin account, new activities in Garmin are automatically uploaded to the Strava. Unfortunately, the Strava does not upload the name and description of the Garmin activity.

**Garmin2FoodFinalSync** updates the name and description from Garmin to Strava for all matching activities between the dates specified.
